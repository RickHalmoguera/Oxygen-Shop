## Overview
This is my inaugural project from the Oxygen Training program, crafted using HTML, SASS, and a touch of JS. You will notice that it boasts a responsive layout, with the mobile version being constructed entirely without the use of flexbox or grid â€“ relying solely on "display: block" or "display: inline-block." The desktop version, on the other hand, indeed leveraged Flexbox.
