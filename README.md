## Overview
This is my inaugural project from the Oxygen Training program, crafted using HTML, SASS, and a touch of JS. You will notice that it boasts a responsive layout, with the mobile version being constructed entirely without the use of flexbox or grid â€“ relying solely on "display: block" or "display: inline-block." The desktop version, on the other hand, indeed leveraged Flexbox.

### Built With

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML)
- [Css](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS)
- [FlexBox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## Features

This site was created as a submission to the Training in [Oxygen Academy](https://oxygenacademy.es/). Where we practice the following points:

- Practicing layout design and identifying common errors, such as excessive use of Flex Box or Grid.
- Manipulating the DOM through JavaScript.
- Sending and requesting data from an API using an API.
- Data validation of a form.

We can observe these practices in the following features:

- A progress bar that displays our scrolling progress on the page.
- A dropdown menu in the mobile version.
- The menu contains links that navigate us to different sections of the page.
- If the user scrolls more than 25% of the page or stays on the page for more than 5 seconds, a modal will appear, asking if we want to subscribe to the newsletter. It won't reappear after closing it.
- In the pricing section, we can switch between USD, EUR, and GBP currencies.
- A slider with 4 images that automatically advances and can also be controlled through two buttons.
- A form that requests our name, email, and a checkbox. This form will validate that all the data is correct before being sent to the server and will provide feedback if the data is correct.
